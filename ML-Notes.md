## what is Machine Learning?
Field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without explicitly programmed.

## Meachine Learning Alogorithms:
- Supervised learning 
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Recommender system

### supervised Learning:
In supervised machine learning, we are learning to create models that combine inputs, to produce useful predictions even on previously unseen data.
**"Right answer"** is given
- Regression: predict continous valued output
- classification: Discret valued output(1 or 0)

**Support Vector Machine : It has infinite no of features or attribuites**
